This project will use docker, fastapi and heroic


basically follow the rubric for "Deploying a Machine Learning Model with FastAPI"
but for this project. Now I'll be able to use github actions here

first I'll create the fastapi and test it using postman
then when I feel good about it, I'll deploy it using github actions
and heoku/render

the post request will ask to give inputs for the stuff,
and the output will be failure or not
I can say the manager can test this by giving inputs to it
since accuracy is 97% this is very reliable.
I'll talk about data validation and other stuff in a future
article.

api will be from fastapi, post request testing will be 
from postman, frondtend will be from streamlit.io


Some kind of chatbot, or something else, will be created and hosted 
In heroku, after this project is finished, I will finish up my 
Website then look for freelance gigs asap
