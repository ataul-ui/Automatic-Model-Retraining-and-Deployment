I think the title for this project can be "Automated Predictive Maintanance for 
Industrial Machinery"


In this repo I will build a recomendation system that let's the manager know
if a certain machinery is likely to fail, and the model will update periodically
as new data appears, (the dataset will be split into initial data trained,
and next month's data trained), thus based on the recomendation of the ml system,
the manager can decide if the machine is due for repairs or not.

talk about the probability of probabilities
aka probability of 2 out of 100 machines failing
look at this video for reference:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA4JkHKZM50&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown 

I'll be using streamlit.io to build the data app for the manager as well
The link will be in the expectation.txt file

^^ I'll use fastapi to create api to connect to streamlit.io

I can add a login that requests username and passwork, so as to 
simulate a manager logining in

wow I can embed it into my medium article as well
https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/embed-your-app 

I will provide the username and passwork in this readme file



hmm maybe I don't even need to use fastapi, just need to use
mlflow, heroku, docker and streamlit


Automatic Model Retraining and Deployment: Build a system that automatically retrains and deploys machine learning models based on predefined triggers or schedules. MLflow can be used for model versioning and management, FastAPI for creating a REST API to trigger the retraining process, Docker for containerization, and Heroku for deployment.

Model Retraining:
MLflow: MLflow is an open-source platform that helps manage the machine learning lifecycle. It provides functionalities for model versioning, experiment tracking, and model management. You can use MLflow to define a predefined trigger or schedule for model retraining. For example, you can set up a schedule to retrain the model every week or trigger retraining when new data is available.
Model Deployment:
FastAPI: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. You can use FastAPI to create a REST API endpoint that triggers the model retraining process. When a predefined trigger or schedule is met, FastAPI can initiate the retraining process by invoking the necessary scripts or workflows.

Docker: Docker is a platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers. In the context of this project, you can containerize your machine learning models, along with the necessary scripts or workflows, using Docker. This ensures that your models and associated components are encapsulated and can be easily deployed in various environments.

Heroku: Heroku is a cloud platform that provides hosting and deployment services. You can deploy your Dockerized machine learning models and associated components on Heroku. Heroku provides scalability, reliability, and ease of deployment. You can configure Heroku to automatically deploy the updated models whenever a new version is available, triggered by the retraining process.

You can configure Heroku to automatically deploy the updated models whenever a new version is available, triggered by the retraining process.

By combining these technologies, you can create an automated pipeline that periodically or conditionally retrains your machine learning models and deploys the updated versions seamlessly. This ensures that your deployed models stay up to date with the latest data and provide accurate predictions or insights. The use of MLflow, FastAPI, Docker, and Heroku streamlines the entire process from retraining to deployment, making it efficient, manageable, and scalable.





User
lets say I want to create a recomendation system, how can I do that using "Automatic Model Retraining and Deployment" project using MLflow, FastAPI, Docker, and Heroku:
ChatGPT
To create a recommendation system using the "Automatic Model Retraining and Deployment" project with MLflow, FastAPI, Docker, and Heroku, you can follow these steps:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Gather the necessary data for your recommendation system, such as user preferences, item details, and historical interactions.
Preprocess and transform the data to a suitable format for model training.
Model Development and Training:

Use MLflow to track and manage your machine learning experiments and model versions.
Develop a recommendation model using techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.
Train the initial model using the collected and prepared data.
Model Evaluation and Validation:

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
Validate the model's accuracy and effectiveness in generating relevant recommendations.
Automatic Model Retraining:

Set up a trigger or schedule in MLflow to initiate the model retraining process. This trigger can be based on predefined criteria like a fixed schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly) or specific data updates.
Implement a script or workflow that fetches the latest data, retrains the recommendation model using the updated dataset, and generates new model versions.
MLflow will track and manage these new model versions along with their associated metadata.
Model Deployment:

Use FastAPI to create a REST API endpoint that can receive user requests and provide recommendation responses.
Containerize the trained recommendation model and the FastAPI application using Docker.
Deploy the Docker container to Heroku, configuring it to automatically update the deployed model whenever a new version is available.
Integration and Usage:

Integrate the deployed recommendation system into your application or platform by making API requests to the FastAPI endpoint.
Users can interact with the system by providing their preferences or accessing personalized recommendations.
Monitoring and Performance Tracking:

Utilize MLflow to monitor the model's performance over time and track relevant metrics.
Continuously evaluate the recommendation system's performance and gather feedback from users to improve its effectiveness.


To use an ML model deployed in Heroku and streamlit.io together, you can follow these general steps:

Deploy your ML model on Heroku: Set up a web server on Heroku that hosts your trained ML model. This can be done using frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI. Ensure that your model is exposed through a RESTful API endpoint.

Build a Streamlit application: Develop a Streamlit application locally on your machine. Streamlit is a Python library for creating interactive web applications for data visualization and ML model deployment.

Integrate the Heroku API into Streamlit: In your Streamlit application, make HTTP requests to the API endpoint of your ML model deployed on Heroku. You can use libraries like requests or higher-level libraries like pydantic or httpx to handle the API calls and data parsing.

Use the ML model in Streamlit: Retrieve the predictions or results from the API response and display them in your Streamlit application. You can create interactive interfaces, visualizations, or any other desired functionality around your ML model using Streamlit's features.

Deploy the Streamlit application: Once you have integrated the Heroku API into your Streamlit application and tested it locally, you can deploy the Streamlit application using Streamlit sharing or other deployment options like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

Access the Streamlit application: Once deployed, you can access the Streamlit application through its URL. The application will make requests to the ML model hosted on Heroku in the background and display the results in the Streamlit user interface.

By combining the power of Heroku for hosting your ML model API and Streamlit for building interactive web applications, you can create a seamless integration to leverage your ML model's predictions and provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with your model.
